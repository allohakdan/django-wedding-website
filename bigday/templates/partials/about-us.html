                A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (on the planet of Lowell, MA), a boy named Dan was running an
                experiment. He wanted to learn how people trust droids when they behaved certain ways, so he brought
                people in to his lab to drive his small droid back and forth again and again.
            </p>
            <p>
                In that same galaxy, a girl named Vicki was taking classes at a university on this very same planet of
                Lowell. She decided to drive the rebellious droid, which did not do anything she wanted. Suddenly the
                droid stopped responding altogether, and the boy saw that it not only disobeyed its driver, but also its
                creator.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the boy waited for his friend to speak with the droid, the two started talking together about what had
                gone wrong. Even though conversing with the driver of the droid was forbidden, the boy liked the look of
                the girl and liked her ideas about droids. And of course, the girl liked the boy's droids, and the idea
                that the two of them could have many adventures together.
            </p>
            <p>
                From that spring onwards, that is exactly what the two of them did. They hope that these adventures will continue
                for a very long time.
